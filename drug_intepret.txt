FROM THE VISUALIZATION:
- If the sodium to potassium level is less than or equal to 14.839,
there are 160 patients that satisfied.

- gini = 0.68: This is the Gini impurity measure, which tells how mixed
the classes are in this node.
    If 0 = pure (all samples belong to one class)
    If >0 = node is mixed

- Value [17, 13, 11, 43, 76] represents the count of patients per
drug class at this node. The order corresponds to the encoded classes:
    Class (Encoded)         Drug Name       Count
    0                       druga           17
    1                       drugb           13
    2                       drugc           11
    3                       drugx           43
    4                       drugy           76
- The model picks the most common drug in the node as the prediction.
Here, drugy is the majority class with 76/160 patients.

Split into subgroups:
- True:
    Patients who have:
    + Na_to_K <= 14.829
    + AND BP <= 0.5 (HIGH)
    -- There are 84 of these patients
       Majority class is drugx, so that would be recommended

- False:
    Patient who have:
    + Na_to_K <= 14.829
    + AND BP = LOW or NORMAL
    -- There are 76 patients
       All received drugy
       Perfectly pure node as gini = 0 (model is very confident)
